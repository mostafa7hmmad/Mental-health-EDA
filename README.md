# Mental-health-EDA
This project explores the relationship between mental health conditions and factors such as work hours, physical activity, education level, stress levels, hours of sleep, and health history. Through comprehensive data exploration and analysis, the project aims to identify patterns and insights that can inform our understanding of how these factors influence mentalÂ well-being.
